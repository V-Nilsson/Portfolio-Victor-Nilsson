I am a .NET student at IT-Högskolan Göteborg, currently looking to get started as a developer with an internship (LIA).


| Course | Description | Projects |
|--------|-------------|----------|
|C#      |Development in MS Studio | https://github.com/V-Nilsson/Labb3 |
|Databases| SQL, MongoDB| |
|Webdevelopment|HTML/CSS, JavaScript, API, Blazor etc| https://github.com/V-Nilsson/WebbUtv-Labb-1 <br> https://github.com/ITHS-gbg/labb-2-back-end-V-Nilsson|

As a part of the webdevelopment course we had a 4 week group project, working agile with the SCRUM framework.
This is the result: https://github.com/YamenITHS/FrolundaArcade
